Oh my god. Just left the theater and I'm still spinning, like I’ve been tossed in a salad bowl with vibes n’ screams. It Feeds is crazy. Those shadows? 👀 Creeps like my aunt’s soup that never stops bubbling on the stove, you know? I swear I still got popcorn bits on my shirt that glow in the dark after all that jump-scare madness.

> The guy behind me kept kicking the seat—felt like a scene of its own while I'm trying to process if the monster’s gonna appear or if it's just an inside-out sweater ghost. Scenes flipping like someone’s shuffling a peg and a unicorn on a merry-go-round, no pause, no breath. I think I heard someone say apropos to nothing, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and that's stuck in my brain like a bit of Sunday brunch omelet from last year. Laugh or scream, right?

> Can't even with the sound design—part crash, part lullaby, with whispers in your ear like someone's trying to sell hair products in the middle of a funeral. Worth 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   again just for the soundtrack, or was that my mashing teeth syncing up to the beats? Who knows?

They used so much blue light, like drowning in an LED pool. My back is doing a protest dance now—seated too long, but oh worth it. Agh, some scenes were like when you mix every hair dye color together and get this unpredictable mess—chaotic but fascinating. The main character, I'm rooting but also like, “Why run into THAT room?!” Horror   logic... pasta colander logic?

My mind’s doing loops—tentacles, whispers, popcorn crumbs everywhere. Someone asked me earlier, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Yeah, I’d say so, if only to untangle the noodle plot. But for now, I’m gonna need to lie down... or at least get rid of these popcorn confetti.
